# MVCfromScratch
## Summary

I wanted to learn how to use C# and ASP.NET in a similar manner to MVC in Node.js and Ruby.  To learn ASP.NET MVC5.0, I followed a few tutorials and built a working application that allows users to login, add, edit and delete items in a list.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Microsoft SQL(Using LocalDb)
- C#
- ASP.NET
- MVC 5.0
